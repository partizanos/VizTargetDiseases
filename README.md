# VizTargetDiseases


Welcome! The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive and confiurable pieChart-web cpomonent making it available to navigate through complicated datasets.

Having a json object (or file) containg data with some minimal information:
1.name 
2.category-type 
3.value 

could build an interactive pieChart visualization.

In this  [example](http://partizanos.github.io/VizTargetDiseases/example/test1.html)
 we visualize relationships among different biological data (protein target, diseases and phenotypes)

## Basic Example Use:


Having included the file in dist folder, you can create can call the web component and pass your data 
(in the correct format) to be visualized.
```
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF8">

<script src="pieChart.js"></script>

<div id="myAwesomeDiv"></div>

<script>

var v = vis()

//pass my div to the visualization library
v(document.getElementById("myAwesomeDiv"));

</script>

```       
    
Configuration can be added such as data to be visualized by passing either an array of json objects or a file directly 


## Configuration Options:

set data input,data filter

set colors of labels/data-points/arcs

set Sizes div/text-font/data-points
