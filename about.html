                    <!-- <br> -->
                    <p>A configurable BioJS visualization component used to analyze and discover relationships in data.<p>
                        <div id="mydiv" style=" width: 600px;" class="line"></div>
                    <h5>Live demo</h5>
                        
                </center>
                <br>
                <div style="padding: 175px;">
                    
                    <h4>Project purpose</h4>
                    
                    <p>The concept of this visualization component is to create summaries of information regarding biological data and ideally serve as a multiprupose tool for data analysis with similar complex structure.</p>
                    
                    <p>The above pie chart attempts to act as a filter in copmplicated data structures containing multiple types (in our case diseases, protein-targets, shared-phenotypes, drugs). And provide a simple but effective way of  analysis.
                    
                    <p>In the initial state the visualization provides an overview of the differnet data types existing in a data structure. </p>
                    
                    <p>Once a pie piece is clicked a user sees all the underlying data of a specific type. </p>
                    
                    <p>Return to the initial stateThe happens via the "Home".</p>

                    <p>The data points depending on their value, which may have different significance, are located in proportionate distances from the center according to that value. The topology permit the end user to acquire an immediate estimation of the distribution of among the dataset.</p>
                    
                    <p>The five rings seperate the circle into five equal pieces trying to accomplish visually a better distinction among data. .
                    By clicking on any of the bull rings, they transition and the clicked one expands until the edge of the circle pushing the dat points accordingly, acting as a filter and focusing on a specific "ring".</p>
                    
                    <p>Lastly the user may click in a specific bullet or label to learn more about an individual object through a small versatile tooltip.</p>

                    The github repository of the web component is located <a href="https://github.com/partizanos/VizTargetDiseases">here</a> with analytical instructions on its use while it has already been uploaded in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=biojs+piechart">npm</a> and <a href="http://www.biojs.io/d/visualize_piechart">biojs</a> registries accordingly.

                    <h4>Experiments & future plans</h4>
                    
                    <p>In the beginning we had experimented with graphs during our effort to find intuitive ways to analyze realtionships of data. The prototypes that were made during this process will be used in 
                    to combine the graph module with the pie chart one in the future. In this case the graphs will contain nodes which are somewhat a more complicated entity.</p>
                    <p>Using a pieChart instead of multiple nodes would greatly reduce the complexity of heavy loaded graphs. Although the graph prototype is in primitive state, for the purpose of this evaluation they were put in <a href="https://github.com/partizanos/earlyExperiments">this</a> repository temporarilly. </p>
                    
                    <h4>Thank note</h4>
                    <p>I would like to thank my mentors Luca Fumis & Miguel Pignatelli for their support and valuable contribution throughout this summer despite their heavy workload and inviting me in the E.B.I. for a User Experience session.
                    I am grateful to the Biojs community for the the great responsivenes and collaborative spirit as well for the rich educational material and their trust which permitted me to contribute to the open-source community which in the future I would like to contribute further since I find this process extremely  educational and creative.
                    Last but not least I would like to thank the organization of GSOC that gives the opportunity and the necessary resources to students to contribute to projects they are passionate about, develop their skills further and contribute to the open-source community.
                    It's been a wonderful summer.      
                    </p>
